# EUC dashboard
Dashboard with ESP32, Nextion NX4024T032 display for my DIY EUC based on Begode Nikola control board and JK Smart BMS. I built them because the EUCs that are available in the market either have a small battery or are extremely expensive.

In my EUC there is a 24s10p battery composed of Samsung INR21700-50E 4900mAh cells with a total capacity of almost 5kWh. This allows me to go on all-day trips and up to a distance of 160 km on a single charge.
