# EUC dashboard
Dashboard with ESP32, Nextion NX4024T032 display for my DIY EUC based on Begode Nikola control board and JK Smart BMS. I built them because the EUCs that are available in the market either have a small battery or are extremely expensive.

In my EUC there is a 24s10p battery composed of Samsung INR21700-50E 4900mAh cells with a total capacity of almost 5kWh. This allows me to go on all-day trips and up to a distance of 160 km on a single charge.

The dashboard is attached to the EUC frame with Velcro. It is only powered from the EUC and all communication is via bluetooth. It is connected to both EUC and BMS simultaneously and displays data from both boards.
